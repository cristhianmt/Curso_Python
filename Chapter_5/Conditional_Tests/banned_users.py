Checking Whether a Value Is Not in a List
Other times, it’s important to know if a value does not appear in a list. You
can use the keyword not in this situation. For example, consider a list of
users who are banned from commenting in a forum. You can check whether
a user has been banned before allowing that person to submit a comment:
"""

banned_users = ['andrew', 'carolina', 'david']
user = 'marie'

if user not in banned_users:
    print(f"{user.title()}, you can post a response if you wish.")

Boolean Expressions
As you learn more about programming, you’ll hear the term Boolean expression
at some point. A Boolean expression is just another name for a conditional
test. A Boolean value is either True or False, just like the value of a conditional
expression after it has been evaluated.
Boolean values are often used to keep track of certain conditions, such
as whether a game is running or whether a user can edit certain content on
a website:

"""
game_active = True 
can_edit = False
