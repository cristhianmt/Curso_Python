Checking for Inequality
When you want to determine whether two values are not equal, you can use
the inequality operator (!=). Let’s use another if statement to examine how to
use the inequality operator. We’ll store a requested pizza topping in a variable
and then print a message if the person did not order anchovies:
"""

request_topping = 'mushrooms'

if request_topping != 'anchovies':
    print("Hold the anchovies")
