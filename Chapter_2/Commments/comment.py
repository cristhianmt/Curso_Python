"""
Comments are an extremely useful feature in most programming languages.
Everything you’ve written in your programs so far is Python code.
As your programs become longer and more complicated, you should add
notes within your programs that describe your overall approach to the
problem you’re solving. A comment allows you to write notes in your spoken
language, within your programs.
