Now we can replace the print() call with 
a loop that runs through the list of toppings and describes the

def make_pizza(*toppings):
    # Summarize the pizza we are about to make.
    print("\nMaking a pizza with the following toppings:")
    for topping in toppings:
        print(f"- {topping}")


make_pizza('pepperoni')
make_pizza('mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese')
