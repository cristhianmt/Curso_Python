Using as to Give a Module an Alias
You can also provide an alias for a module name. Giving a module a 
short alias, like p for pizza, allows you to call the moduleâ€™s
functions more quickly. Calling p.make_pizza() is more concise 
than calling pizza.make_pizza():
"""

import pizza as p
p.make_pizza(16, 'pepperoni')
p.make_pizza(12, 'mushrooms', 'green peppers',
                 'green peppers', 'extra cheese')
