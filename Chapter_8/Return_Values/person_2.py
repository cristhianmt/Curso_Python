"""
This function takes in simple textual
information and puts it into a more meaningful
data structure that lets you work with the information
beyond just printing it. The strings 'jimi' and 'hendrix'
are now labeled as a first name and last name. You can easily
extend this function to accept optional values like a middle
name, an age, an occupation, or any other information you
want to store about a person. For example, the following change
allows you to store a personâ€™s age as well:
