Making an Argument Optional
Sometimes it makes sense to make an argument optional, so that people using the function can choose to provide extra information only if they want to. You can use default values to make an argument optional.
For example, say we want to expand get_formatted_name() to handle middle names as well. A first attempt to include middle names might look like this:
"""


def get_formatted_name(first_name, middle_name, last_name):
    # Return a full name, neatly formatted.
    full_name = f"{first_name} {middle_name} {last_name}"
    return full_name.title()


musician = get_formatted_name('john', 'lee', 'hooker')
print(musician)

print("\n")
"""
But middle names arenâ€™t always needed, and this function as
 written would not work if you tried to call it with only a 
 first name and a last name. To make the middle name optional, 
 we can give the middle_name argument an empty default value 
 and ignore the argument unless the user provides a value. 
 To make get_formatted_name() work without a middle name, 
 we set the default value of middle_name to an empty string 
 and move it to the end of the list of parameters:
"""


def get_formatted_name(first_name, last_name, middle_name=''):
    # Return a full name, neatly formatted.
    if middle_name:
        full_name = f"{first_name} {middle_name} {last_name}"
    else:
        full_name = f"{first_name} {last_name}"
    return full_name.title()


musician = get_formatted_name('jimi', 'hendrix')
print(musician)

musician = get_formatted_name('john', 'hooker', 'lee')
print(musician)
