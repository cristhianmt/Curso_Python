Positional Arguments
When you call a function, Python must match each argument in the function call with a parameter in the function definition. The simplest way to
do this is based on the order of the arguments provided. Values matched up this way are called positional arguments.
To see how this works, consider a function that displays information about pets. The function tells us what kind of animal each pet is and the pet’s name, as shown here:
"""


def describe_pet(animal_type, pet_name):
    # Display information about a pet.
    print(f"\nI have a {animal_type}")
    print(f"My {animal_type}'s name is {pet_name.title()}.")

describe_pet('hamster', 'harry')
describe_pet('dog', 'willie')
