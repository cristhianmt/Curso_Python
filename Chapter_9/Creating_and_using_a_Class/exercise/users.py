"""
9-3. Users: Make a class called User. Create 
two attributes called first_name and last_name, 
and then create several other attributes that are 
typically stored in a user profile. Make a method 
called describe_user() that prints a summary of the userâ€™s 
information. Make another method called greet_user() that
 prints a personalized greeting to the user.
Create several instances representing different 
users, and call both methods for each user.
