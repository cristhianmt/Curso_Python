Adding New Key-Value Pairs
Dictionaries are dynamic structures, and you can add new key-value pairs
to a dictionary at any time. To add a new key-value pair, you would give the
name of the dictionary followed by the new key in square brackets, along
with the new value.
Let’s add two new pieces of information to the alien_0 dictionary: the
alien’s x- and y-coordinates, which will help us display the alien at a particular
position on the screen. Let’s place the alien on the left edge of the
screen, 25 pixels down from the top. Because screen coordinates usually
start at the upper-left corner of the screen, we’ll place the alien on the left
edge of the screen by setting the x-coordinate to 0 and 25 pixels from the
top by setting its y-coordinate to positive 25, as shown here:
"""

alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'points': 5}
print(alien_0)

alien_0['x_position'] = 0
alien_0['y_position'] = 25
print(alien_0)
