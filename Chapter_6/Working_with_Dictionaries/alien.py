"""
A dictionary in Python is a collection of key-value pairs. Each key is connected to
a value, and you can use a key to access the value associated with that key. A
keyâ€™s value can be a number, a string, a list, or even another dictionary. In fact,
you can use any object that you can create in Python as a value in a dictionary.
In Python, a dictionary is wrapped in braces ({}) with a series of key-value
pairs inside the braces, as shown in the earlier example:

alien_0 = {'color': 'green'}
print(alien_0['color'])
