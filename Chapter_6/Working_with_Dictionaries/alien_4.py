Starting with an Empty Dictionary
It’s sometimes convenient, or even necessary, to start with an empty dictionary
and then add each new item to it. To start filling an empty dictionary,
define a dictionary with an empty set of braces and then add each key-value
pair on its own line. For example, here’s how to build the alien_0 dictionary
using this approach:

"""

alien_0 = {}

alien_0['color'] = 'green'
alien_0['points'] = 5

print(alien_0)
