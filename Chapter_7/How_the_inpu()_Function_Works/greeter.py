Writing Clear Prompts
Each time you use the input() function, you should include a clear, easy-tofollow
prompt that tells the user exactly what kind of information youâ€™re
looking for. Any statement that tells the user what to enter should work. For
example:
"""
name = input("Please enter your name: ")
print(f"\nHello, {name}!")
