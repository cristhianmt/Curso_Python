How the input() Function Works
The input() function pauses your program and waits for the user to enter
some text. Once Python receives the userâ€™s input, it assigns that input to a
variable to make it convenient for you to work with.
For example, the following program asks the user to enter some text,
then displays that message back to the user:
"""
message = input("tell me something, and I wil repeat it back to you: ")
print(message)
