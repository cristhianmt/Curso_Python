"""
Sometimes you’ll want to write a prompt that’s longer than one line.
For example, you might want to tell the user why you’re asking for certain
input. You can assign your prompt to a variable and pass that variable to the
input() function. This allows you to build your prompt over several lines,
then write a clean input() statement.

prompt = "If you share your name, we can personalize the messages you see."
prompt += "\nWhat is your first name? "
