"""
The modulo operator doesnâ€™t tell you how many times one number fits
into another; it only tells you what the remainder is.
When one number is divisible by another number, the remainder is 0,
so the modulo operator always returns 0. You can use this fact to determine
if a number is even or odd:
"""

number = input("Enter a number, and I'll tell you if it's even or odd: ")
number = int(number)

if number % 2 == 0: 
    print(f"\nThe number {number} is even.")
else:
    print(f"\nThe number {number} is odd.")
