"""
To reverse the original order of a list, you can use the reverse() method. If
we originally stored the list of cars in chronological order according to when
we owned them, we could easily rearrange the list into reverse-chronological
order:
"""
cars = ['bmw', 'audi','toyota','subaru']
print(cars)

cars.reverse()
print(cars)
