"""
Lists are ordered collections, so you can access any element in a list by
telling Python the position, or index, of the item desired. To access an element
in a list, write the name of the list followed by the index of the item
enclosed in square brackets.
For example, let’s pull out the first bicycle in the list bicycles:
"""

bicycles = ['trek', 'cannondale', 'redline', 'specialized']
print(bicycles[2])

print("\nTitle")
print(bicycles[3].title())
print("\nUpper")
print(bicycles[3].upper())
